" Multiple Windows and Tabs {{{

	" multiple tab pages to edit multiple files, but it is still best to 
	" enable an option to allow easier switching between files.
	
	" One such option is the 'hidden' option, which allows you to re-use the 
	" same window and switch from an unsaved buffer without saving it first. 
	" Also allows you to keep an undo history for multiple files when re-using 
	" the same window in this way. Note that using persistent undo also lets 
	" you undo in multiple files even in the same window, but is less 
	" efficient and is actually designed for keeping undo history after 
	" closing Vim entirely. Vim will complain if you try to quit without saving
	" and swap files will keep you safe if your computer crashes.
	set hidden
	
	" Note that not everyone likes working this way (with the hidden option).

	" same window as mentioned above, and/or either of the following options:
